# Is It SQL
A simple SQL Server monitoring tool to determine if SQL Server is causing the current problem.

This is designed to allow a moderately technical person to determine if SQL Server is likely the cause of any current issue.  A screenshot can be sent to a Database Administrator to decide if further follow up is needed.  It runs entirely in memory and doesn't require SQL Server itself to run.  It only has a one-hour history.

## What's New

### 2.5 (August 2025) 
* Option to store key server metrics in a SQL Server Database
* Support protocols for connections such as "tcp:fqdn.com".  It supports "tcp", "np" (named pipes), and "lpc" (shared memory).  The default is "tcp".  The Server Information page has a link to the Server Connection page that will show the connection details.
* Upgraded jQuery and Bootstrap.  This no longer supports Internet Explorer.
* Ignore distributed Availability Groups for now
* Added an Outbound Connections page at `/connections` that shows the FQDN, @@SERVERNAME, protocol, and authorization scheme for all the SQL Server connections.
* Improved Javascript error handling
* Cleaned up nesting in the HTML templates

### 2.3 (January 2025)
* Added SQL Server Agent jobs.  The IsItSQL service account needs `db_datareader` and `SQLAgentReaderRole` in `msdb`.
* Added Prometheus metrics.  See the About page for the link.
* Reduced locking
* Fixed issue with charts always in UTC
* Updated GO version and all dependencies
